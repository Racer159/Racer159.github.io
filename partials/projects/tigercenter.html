	<p>
		Tiger Center was a web application that I helped create as part of my work at the Student IT Office.  It serves
		as a fresh interface for the Oracle Campus Solutions enrollment application that RIT uses.  It uses modern web frameworks
		such as Angular.js and SASS for the front end, and provides a much more dynamic and fluid experience for its
		users.  I was lucky enough to be a part of this project from start to finish, and was able to really understand the processes
		that go into designing, developing, deploying, and maintaining enterprise-level web applications.  You can learn more
