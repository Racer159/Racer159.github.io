	Project Atlas was a project I worked on while I was an intern at Microsoft along with other fellow interns.  The basic idea 
	was to create a physical implementation of social media, and to see how far that implementation could travel.  To accomplish this, 
	we placed Windows Phones with custom software running on them inside a laser-cut enclosure with speakers, lights, and a custom PCB
	to drive everything off of the audio jack on the phone.  This came together to create what we dubbed an "Explorer."  We ran this 
	experiment for a few months, and found that the Explorers travelled coast to coast, and some even migrated to Canada.  You can learn
