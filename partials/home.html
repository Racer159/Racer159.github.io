			Hi, I am a fourth year Software Engineering student currently attending Rochester Institute of Technology with a great passion for technology.  
			I have been using computers for as long as I can remember, and enjoy all kinds of technology from software to hardware.  
			I am also always up for learning new things, and finding new things I can do with the stuff I already have.
			Using the links above you can view some of my projects, view my resume, or if you want to you can play with the alarm clock below.
